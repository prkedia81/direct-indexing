    "We compare the quantity of each share in data and in the master DataFrame. There will be 3 variables, one which calculates the amount we will have to spend, that is the extra number of shares we will have to buy. The second variable will keep track of the amount we will receive that is in profit, i.e, the shares which we will sell at a price greater than our cost price. The third variable will store the amount we will receive which is in loss, i.e, the shares which we will sell at a price lower than our cost price. Using these three variables, plus our available cash, we will first determine if any transaction is possible at all. This means that, if the total cash is in -ve then we cannot rebalance the entire portfolio. If we cannot rebalance our portfolio, there can be a feature added which will selectively rebalance our portfolio but that is something we will look into later. Right now, if the total cash comes out to be -ve, we will skip the rebalancing and let the portfolio stay as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the total cash is greater or equal to zero. This means that we have just enough money to rebalance our portfolio. At this point, we will actually (on paper that is) start buying and selling stocks. We will first have to sell off our stocks to raise enough capital to buy the required securities. I think, in the above step, we can maintain a dictionary, with the key being the index number and the value being the amount. Then, using the index numbers, we can loop through the sales, updating the cash with each sale. Finally, afte the cash is updated, we will start looping through the buy section. \n",
